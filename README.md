## Getting started

- Ensure you have [nvm](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/nvm) installed to allow switching between different _node_ versions easier.
- Run `nvm use` which should switch you to _node v14.16.2_ if it's installed, otherwise it should prompt you to install it.
- After you're on the correct version of _node_ run `npm install` which will install all necessary dependencies.
- Run `npm start dev` to start the dev server and enjoy speedy hot-reloading powered by [vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Good to know commands

> Before anything run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the right version of _node_.

```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run dev
```
